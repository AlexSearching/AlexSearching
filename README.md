- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexSearching
- 👀 I’m interested in programming video games with python (pygame). My current project is creating a chess game where two humans can play against each other (no AI).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to get better with pygame and overall get into the world of programming:D
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on sharing my experience as well as sharing knowledge. 
- 📫 How to reach me: you can contact me via lucadepietro37@gmail.com
